Obscure The Light based on Eclipse 2nd Dawn

This is a recreation of the table top strategy game Eclipse, more specifically the second version, designed by Touko Tahkokallio.

Its manual is useful in understanding the game.

Under releases is a compiled zip of the gamemaker code, and can be ran from the folder once unzipped.

There are some bugs, and unintended behavior.

The playable species are:
1. Empire (Eridani Empire)
2. Wet (Hydran Progress)
3. Plants (Planta)
4. Pirates (Descendants of Draco)
5. Machine (Mechanema)
6. Space Marines (Orion Hegemony)
7. Terran (Terran)

In the start screen you can choose number of players, their specie, the number of rounds, and the number of researchs in each tech.
